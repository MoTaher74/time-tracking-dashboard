##  About the Project:

This project is a dynamic and interactive Time Tracking Dashboard built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It features a fully responsive design that adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.
Users can switch between different timeframes (Daily, Weekly, Monthly) to view activity data in an intuitive way.

## Key Challenges I Overcame:

Implementing a responsive design to ensure compatibility across various devices.
Loading and dynamically displaying data from an external JSON file.
Enhancing user experience with simple and effective interactive features.

## Technologies Used:

HTML5: For building the projectâ€™s structure.
CSS3: To create a sleek and engaging design.
Vanilla JavaScript: For interactivity and data fetching from the JSON file.

# Why Did I Build This Project? I wanted to challenge myself by developing a practical project that showcases my skills in programming and responsiveness, while also delivering a clean and user-friendly interface.
